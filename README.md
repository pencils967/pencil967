##Hey Hey!

I am an ML enthusiast, a Post Grad in Physics and an avid learner. 
I like recognising(yes, I said recognising. Minor Brag) the math that goes in the ML algorithms
and deploying my knowledge in small projects to keep my skills updated. I am also interested in learning Computer vision.
For now I am also trying to foray into learning Django. 

:paperclip: I like to keep my Physics knowledge intact by watching countless videos. 

:clipboard: I would love to work on ML projects. 

:badminton: I love playing Badminton
